## Description

This assignment tasked me with building a portfolio using REACT to help set myself apart from other Developers. I found this assignment to actually be fairly easy (minus all the files I had to make) and fun to work on. I am starting to enjoy developing and coding alot more now that the courses is coming closer to an end.
